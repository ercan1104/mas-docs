## Uses In Powershell One Liner

```powershell
& ([ScriptBlock]::Create((irm https://mass grave.dev/get))) /para
```

**Notes** - Remove the space betweenÂ `mass grave`

-   Replace `/para` in this command with the switches from the above table. You can also use multiple switches. For example, `/HWID /KMS-Office /KMS-ActAndRenewalTask`
-   This Powershell one-liner will work on Windows 8.1 and later versions only.
-   To change the edition through the command line, check [here](change_edition.html#Manual_Edition_Change). We didn't automate it in MAS because it requires a reboot in some cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rules

-   Script will run in unattended mode if any switch is used.

-   `/S` switch is not applicable in MAS separate files version scripts.

-   All switches are case-insensitive, and work in any order, but must be separated with spaces.

-   KMS Uninstall switch will take precedence over other KMS switches.

-   KMS38 remove protection switch will take precedence over KMS38 activation.
