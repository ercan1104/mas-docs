# Office C2R Custom Install

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes

-   If the below guide is confusing to you then the simplest option for you is to use [Office C2R Installer](office_c2r_links.html).

-   Retail Office (e.g. O365) has latest feature updates and Volume Office (e.g. ProPlus 2021) doesn't. Both can be activated using Ohook activation method.

-   Please note that in the official C2R office custom installation method, there is no ISO or any one-click solution available. Below is the simplest guide to installing customized office.

-   Russian users needs to follow [this guide](bypass-russian-geoblock.html) to bypass geoblock in Office downloading.

## Custom Installation Guide

First, you'll need to clear previous installations of Office. You can skip this if Office has never been installed on the machine before:

-   Uninstall Office with the App and Features option in Windows settings.

-   Run `OfficeScrubber.cmd` file from [Office Scrubber](https://github.com/abbodi1406/WHD/raw/master/scripts/OfficeScrubber_11.7z) by abbodi1406 and select `[R] Remove all Licenses` option.

Once you're done:

-   Download [Office Deployment Tool](https://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/wsus/setup.exe) (ODT)

-   Copy the downloaded `setup.exe` file to the root of the C drive, i.e. `C:\setup.exe`

-   Go to [config.office.com](https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings)

-   If you want Retail Office then select `Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise` in the office suites section.

-   If you want Volume Office then select `Office LTSC Professional Plus 2021 - Volume License` in the office suites section. (Don't select the SPLA version)

-   You can add Visio and Project apps if you need them. Don't select language that is [not available for Project/Visio](office_c2r_links.html) if you are installing those apps.

-   Customize other things and leave settings as default if you don't understand something.

-   Once you go through all the options, click on the export button, select "Keep Current Settings" option and it will download a file named `Configuration.xml`

-   Copy the downloaded `Configuration.xml` file to the root of the C drive, i.e. `C:\Configuration.xml`

-   Open the command prompt as admin and run the below commands

    ```bat
    cd /d C:\
    setup.exe /configure Configuration.xml
    ```

It will now download and install Office. You can activate it with your preferred method.

## Microsoft Office 2024 (Preview)

Official Office Deployment Tool (ODT) is not yet allowing the installation of Microsoft Office 2024 however its license files are available in the Office DevMain (Dogfood) Channel. Official notes from Microsoft regarding Office 2024 have not been released yet.

We can use alternative steps to get the files and install them.

-   Download Office files for DevMain (Dogfood) Channel with [YAOCTRU](https://github.com/abbodi1406/WHD/raw/master/scripts/YAOCTRU_v9.0.zip)
-   Extract `YAOCTRI_Configurator.cmd` file from [YAOCTRI](https://github.com/abbodi1406/WHD/raw/master/scripts/YAOCTRI_v10.7.zip)Â and place this file besides `Office` Folder which was downloaded by YAOCTRU
-   Now run `YAOCTRI_Configurator.cmd` as admin to install Office
-   When Office installation is done, activate with Ohook option in MAS

Just FYI, Office 365 has most features, not 2024.
